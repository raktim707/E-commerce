# E-commerce
A newspaper web application built with django, python, html5 and css.
It has a robust user authentication flow including the use of email for password resets.
We are also using a custom user model so if we want to add additional fields 
to our CustomUser model it is as simple as adding an additional field.
I have created a dedicated articles app with CRUD functionality and comment system.
